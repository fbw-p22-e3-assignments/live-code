# What is DNS?
##	DNS basics

DNS services translate human-readable names into numeric IP addresses

All computers on the Internet find and communicate with one another by using numbers, called IP addresses. 

In our web browser, we use domain names like example.com and still end up in the right place.

A DNS service is a globally distributed service that translates human-readable names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. 

The Internet’s DNS system works much like a phone book by managing the mapping between names and numbers.

##	Types of DNS Service

Remember 2 types of DNS services: authoritative and recursive

Authoritative DNS:  An authoritative DNS service provides an update mechanism that developers use to manage their public DNS names. It then answers DNS queries, translating domain names into IP address so computers can communicate with each other.  Authoritative DNS has the final authority over a domain and is responsible for providing answers to recursive DNS servers with the IP address information. 

Recursive DNS:  Clients typically do not make queries directly to authoritative DNS services.  Instead, they generally connect to another type of DNS service known a resolver, or a recursive DNS service.  If a recursive DNS has the DNS reference cached, or stored for a period of time, then it answers the DNS query by providing the source or IP information. If not, it passes the query to one or more authoritative DNS servers to find the information.
	
##	DNS Traffic Routing
	
![Alt text](images/im44.png?raw=true "Title")

1. A user opens a web browser, enters www.example.com in the address bar, and presses Enter.
2. The request for www.example.com is routed to a DNS resolver, which is typically managed by the user's Internet service provider (ISP), such as a cable Internet provider, a DSL broadband provider, or a corporate network.
3. The DNS resolver for the ISP forwards the request for www.example.com to a DNS root name server.
4. The DNS resolver for the ISP forwards the request for www.example.com again, this time to one of the TLD name servers for .com domains. The name server for .com domains responds to the request with the names of the four Cloud DNS name servers that are associated with the example.com domain.
5. The DNS resolver for the ISP chooses a Cloud DNS name server and forwards the request for www.example.com to that name server.
6. The Cloud DNS name server looks in the example.com hosted zone for the www.example.com record, gets the associated value, such as the IP address for a web server, 192.0.2.44, and returns the IP address to the DNS resolver.
7. The DNS resolver for the ISP finally has the IP address that the user needs. The resolver returns that value to the web browser. The DNS resolver also caches (stores) the IP address for example.com for an amount of time that you specify so that it can respond more quickly the next time someone browses to example.com. For more information, see time to live (TTL).
8. The web browser sends a request for www.example.com to the IP address that it got from the DNS resolver. This is where your content is, for example, a web server running on a Compute Engine instance or a Cloud Storage bucket that's configured as a website endpoint.
9. The web server or other resource at 192.0.2.44 returns the web page for www.example.com to the web browser, and the web browser displays the page.

# What is Google Cloud DNS?
##	Google Cloud DNS

Google Cloud DNS is a scalable, reliable, and managed authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) service running on the same infrastructure as Google. 

It has low latency, high availability and is a cost-effective way to make the applications and services available to the users. 

It can be easily published and manage millions of DNS zones and records using Google’s simple user interface, command-line interface or API.

##	Google Cloud DNS - Zones

Cloud DNS offers both public zones and private managed DNS zones. 
- Public zone is visible to the public internet.
- Private zone is visible only from one or more Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks that is specified. 

# Understanding Google Cloud Network
##	Google Cloud Network

Google is dedicated to building infrastructure that lets to modernize and run the workloads, and connect with more users, no matter where they are in the world. 

Part of this infrastructure is:
- extensive global network - provides connectivity to Google Cloud customers
- edge network - allows connecting with ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and end customers

Let’s now describe the various network points of presence within Google’s edge, how they connect to Google Cloud, and how traffic hand-offs occur.

##	Google Edge POP

Edge POPs (Points Of Presence) are where Google's network is connected to the Internet via peering. 
- Google is present on over 180 internet exchanges and at over 160 interconnection facilities around the world. 
- Google operates a large, global meshed network that connects the edge POPs to customers data centers. It brings Google traffic closer to their clients, thereby reducing the costs, latency, and providing end users with a better experience. 
- Google directly interconnects with all major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and the vast majority of traffic from Google's network to their customers is transmitted via direct interconnections with the client's ISP.

##	Cloud Interconnect POP

Dedicated Interconnect provides direct physical connections between client’s on-premises network and Google's network. 
- It enables to efficiently transfer large amounts of data between networks
- To use Dedicated Interconnect, the client’s network must physically meet Google's network in a supported colocation facility, also known as an Interconnect connection location
- Customers may also use Partner Interconnect to connect to Google through a supported service provider

# CDN?
##	What is a CDN?

A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers (points of presence) which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content

A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos 

A properly configured CDN may also help protect websites against some common malicious attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks

##	Google Cloud CDN

Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network) uses Google's globally distributed edge POPs to cache Cloud content close to end users. 

Cloud CDN relies on infrastructure at edge POPs that Google uses to cache content associated with its own web properties that serve billions of users. 

This reduces latency and ensures that customers have capacity for large traffic spikes (for example, for streaming media events or holiday sales).

##	Google Cloud CDN Key Features

- Global distribution with anycast IP
Peered with every major end-user ISP globally, Cloud CDN offers connectivity to users almost everywhere.
Thanks to anycast architecture, your site gets a single global IP address, combining consistent performance worldwide with easy management. 

- Optimized for last-mile performance
Cloud CDN supports modern protocols originally developed at Google, like HTTP/2 and QUIC, to improve site performance for mobile users and/or users in emerging markets.

- Integrated with Google Cloud
Google Cloud CDN is integrated with many Google Cloud services for easy set-up.

##	How Google Cloud CDN works
								
1. The journey starts when a user requests one of client’s web pages.
			
2. Google responds to the user's request from an Edge Network location that will provide the lowest latency.
						
3. Google’s Edge Network receives the user's request and passes it to the nearest Google data center.			

4.	The data center generates a response that's optimized to provide the best experience for the user at that time.

5. 	The app or browser retrieves the requested content. This can come from multiple Google locations, including Google’s data 
centers, Edge POPs, and Edge Nodes.	

##	Google Cloud CDN Cost Estimation
Cache egress
- Cached responses served from Cloud CDN's caches
- Vary based on the destination and the monthly usage 

Cache fill 
- Data required to populate Cloud CDN's caches 
- Charges vary based on the source and destination

Cache lookup requests
- GET and HEAD HTTP methods
