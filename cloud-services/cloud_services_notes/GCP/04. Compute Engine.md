# What a VM is?
##	What is a VM?

![Alt text](images/im48.png?raw=true "Title")

A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer
A VM runs on a physical computer, which is called a host
A software layer, which is called a hypervisor, provides access to the resources of the physical computer (CPU, memory, disk, network) to the VM
The VM runs its own operating system (OS) and interacts with the host through the hypervisor
Multiple VMs can be provisioned on a single host
Virtualization enables you to create multiple VMs, each with its own OS and applications, on a single physical machine.


##	What are VMs used for?

![Alt text](images/im49.png?raw=true "Title")

There are many ways virtual machines are used:
Building and deploying apps to the cloud.
Trying out a new operating system (OS), including beta releases.
Spinning up a new environment to make it simpler and quicker for developers to run dev-test scenarios.
Backing up your existing OS.
Accessing virus-infected data or running an old application by installing an older OS.
Running software or apps on operating systems that they weren't originally intended for.

# Benefits of VMs
##	Benefits of VMs

While virtual machines run like individual computers with individual operating systems and applications, they have the advantage of remaining completely independent of one another and the physical host machine. A piece of software called a hypervisor, or virtual machine manager, lets you run different operating systems on different virtual machines at the same time. This makes it possible to run Linux VMs, for example, on a Windows OS, or to run an earlier version of Windows on more current Windows OS.

And, because VMs are independent of each other, they're also extremely portable. You can move a VM on a hypervisor to another hypervisor on a completely different machine almost instantaneously.
Because of their flexibility and portability, virtual machines provide many benefits, such as:

- Cost savings—running multiple virtual environments from one piece of infrastructure means that you can drastically reduce your physical infrastructure footprint. This boosts your bottom line—decreasing the need to maintain nearly as many servers and saving on maintenance costs and electricity.
- Agility and speed—Spinning up a VM is relatively easy and quick and is much simpler than provisioning an entire new environment for your developers. Virtualization makes the process of running dev-test scenarios a lot quicker.
- Lowered downtime—VMs are so portable and easy to move from one hypervisor to another on a different machine—this means that they are a great solution for backup, in the event the host goes down unexpectedly.
- Scalability—VMs allow you to more easily scale your apps by adding more physical or virtual servers to distribute the workload across multiple VMs. As a result you can increase the availability and performance of your apps.
- Security benefits— Because virtual machines run in multiple operating systems, using a guest operating system on a VM allows you to run apps of questionable security and protects your host operating system. VMs also allow for better security forensics, and are often used to safely study computer viruses, isolating the viruses to avoid risking their host computer.

Cost savings – For example, you don’t need to buy a new machine if you want to run a different operating system (OS) on your existing machine. You create a VM with the new OS and run it on your machine with virtualization software.

Efficiency – You can run multiple VMs on a single physical computer to handle different types of workloads and increase its utilization. VMs enable you to reduce computing resource waste due to under-utilized servers.

Reusability and portability – A virtual machine image defines all of the configuration, software, and applications that are installed in a VM. You can duplicate a VM image on one or more physical hosts without creating a new VM from scratch. This duplication promotes reusability and portability. For example, creating multiple copies of the same VM to respond to incoming requests can improve your applications’ performance when the number of requests increases. You can also copy a VM image to a different host for backup purposes

# VMs in Cloud
##	Google Compute Engine
Google Compute Engine (GCE) - secure and customizable compute service that lets you create and run virtual machines on Google’s infrastructure.
GCE is used as a server resource instead of acquiring and managing server hardware.
You can create an instance by using the Google Cloud Console, the gcloud command-line tool, or the Compute Engine API.

![Alt text](images/im51.png?raw=true "Title")

##	Google Compute Engine
- Compute Engine is a zonal service
- Provides fast-booting VMs that you can rent on demand
- It is Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
- Offers different machine types - standard, highmem, highcpu or custom CPU/RAM
- You pay by the second (60 second min.) for CPUs, RAM
- Automatically cheaper if you keep running it (“sustained use discount”)
- Even cheaper for “preeemptible” or long-term use commitment in a region
- Can add GPUs and paid OSes for extra cost
- Live Migration: Google seamlessly moves instance across hosts, as needed

Compute Engine instances can run the public images for Linux and Windows Server that Google provides, as well as private custom images that you can create or import from your existing systems. 

You can also deploy Docker containers, which are automatically launched on instances running the Container-Optimized OS public image. Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

You can choose the machine properties of your instances, such as the number of virtual CPUs and the amount of memory, by using a set of predefined machine types or by creating your own custom machine types.

Machine types:
- General-purpose - best price-performance ratio for a variety of workloads
- Compute-optimized - the highest performance per core on Compute Engine and optimized for compute-intensive workloads
- Memory-optimized - ideal for memory-intensive workloads, offering more memory per core than other machine families, with up to 12 TB of memory
- Accelerator-optimized - ideal for massively parallelized Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) compute workloads, such as machine learning (ML) and high performance computing (HPC). This family is the best option for workloads that require GPUs

##	Creating Compute Engine instance
You can create a new CE instance the following ways:
- from scratch
- from template
- from machine image
- from marketplace

![Alt text](images/im53.png?raw=true "Title")

Choices made when creating from scratch:

1. Name, Region and Zone
2. Machine configuration
3. Confidential VM Service
4. Container
5. Boot disk
6. Identity and API access
7. Firewall
8. Networking
9. Disks
10. Security
11. Management
12. Sole-tenacy

1. You need to name your instance here and chose region & zone. You can add labels to e.g. indicate different environments.

![Alt text](images/im54.png?raw=true "Title")

2. You can use a selector which help you choose machine type you need: https://cloudcomputevms.withgoogle.com/

![Alt text](images/im55.png?raw=true "Title")

A Confidential Virtual Machine (Confidential VM) is a type of N2D Compute Engine VM running on hosts based on the second generation of AMD Epyc processors. 

Confidential VM features built-in optimization of both performance and security for enterprise-class high memory workloads, as well as inline memory encryption that doesn't introduce significant performance penalty to those workloads.

![Alt text](images/im56.png?raw=true "Title")

Compute Engine instances support a declarative method for launching your applications using containers. 
You can provide a Docker image name and launch configuration. 

Compute Engine will take care of the rest, including supplying an up-to-date Container-Optimized OS image with Docker installed and launching your container when the VM starts up.

![Alt text](images/im57.png?raw=true "Title")

Each instance requires a disk to boot from. 
You can do the following:
- select an image or snapshot to create a new boot disk 
- attach an existing disk to the instance.

By default, each Compute Engine instance has a small boot persistent disk that contains the operating system. 
When applications running on your instance require more storage space, you can add additional storage options to your instance.

![Alt text](images/im58.png?raw=true "Title")

Disk types:
- Standard persistent disks (pd-standard) are backed by standard hard disk drives (HDD).
- Balanced persistent disks (pd-balanced) are backed by SSD drives. They are an alternative to SSD persistent disks that balance performance and cost.
- SSD persistent disks (pd-ssd) are backed by SSD drives.
- Extreme persistent disks (pd-extreme) are backed by solid-state drives (SSD). With high performance for both random access workloads and bulk throughput, they are designed for high-end database workloads. Also, you can provision your desired IOPS.

Apps running on your instances can authorize and interact with Google Cloud APIs through a service account. Service accounts with the necessary Compute Engine IAM roles can allow your app code to execute specific API requests.

![Alt text](images/im59.png?raw=true "Title")

By default, all incoming traffic from outside a network is blocked. You need to select the type of network traffic you want to allow. 

![Alt text](images/im60.png?raw=true "Title")

Network tags - allows applying firewall rules to specific VM instances
Forwarding - allows the instance to help route packets.

![Alt text](images/im61.png?raw=true "Title")

If you need additional storage, you can add a disk or attach an existing one:

![Alt text](images/im62.png?raw=true "Title")

Shielded VM offers verifiable integrity of your Compute Engine VM instances, so you can be confident your instances haven't been compromised by boot- or kernel-level malware or rootkits.

In this section, you can also add additional SSH Keys.

![Alt text](images/im63.png?raw=true "Title")

Deletion protection - VM instance can be protected from accidental deletion.

Reservations - ensure that your project has resources for increases in demand, including: planned or unplanned spikes, migrating numerous VM instances, backup and disaster recovery, or planned growth and buffer.

Metadata:
Every VM instance stores its metadata on a metadata server. VM automatically has access to the metadata server API without any additional authorization. Metadata is stored as key:value pairs.
Example usage of metadata entries:
- Startup and shutdown scripts
- Host maintenance
- Guest attributes
- Security

Availability policy:
- Preemptibility:
Preemptible VM instances are available at much lower price—a 60-91% discount—compared to the price of standard VMs. However, Compute Engine might stop (preempt) these instances if it needs to reclaim those resources for other tasks. Preemptible instances are excess Compute Engine capacity, so their availability varies with usage.
- On host maintenance:
By default, standard instances are set to live migrate, where Compute Engine automatically migrates an instance away from an infrastructure maintenance event, and instance remains running during the migration. Instance might experience a short period of decreased performance, although generally most instances should not notice any difference. This is ideal for instances that require constant uptime, and can tolerate a short period of decreased performance.
If you do not want your instance to live migrate, you can choose to stop and optionally restart your instance. For VMs set to stop and optionally restart, Compute Engine sends a soft power-off signal to shutdown the instance, waits 60 seconds for the instance to shut down cleanly, terminates the instance, and restarts it away from the maintenance event. If the instance doesn't shut down cleanly in 60 seconds, it is terminated.
- Automatic restart:
If an instance is set to stop when there is a maintenance event, or if an instance crashes because of an underlying hardware issue, you can set up Compute Engine to automatically restart the instance by setting the automaticRestart field to true. This setting does not apply if the instance is taken offline through a user action, such as calling sudo shutdown, or during a zone outage.

Sole-tenancy lets you have exclusive access to a sole-tenant node, which is a physical Compute Engine server that is dedicated to hosting only your project's VMs. Use sole-tenant nodes to keep your VMs physically separated from VMs in other projects, or to group your VMs together on the same host hardware, as shown in the following diagram:

![Alt text](images/im66.png?raw=true "Title")
Source: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/sole-tenant-nodes

The following types of workloads might benefit from using sole-tenant nodes:
- Gaming workloads with performance requirements.
- Finance or healthcare workloads with security and compliance requirements.
- Windows workloads with licensing requirements.
- Machine learning, data processing, or image rendering workloads. For these workloads, consider reserving GPUs.
- Workloads requiring increased input/output operations per second (IOPS) and decreased latency, or workloads that use temporary storage in the form of caches, processing space, or low-value data. For these workloads, consider reserving local SSDs.

![Alt text](images/im67.png?raw=true "Title")

Node affinity labels:
Sole-tenant nodes ensure that your VMs do not share host hardware with VMs from other projects.
However, you still might want to group several workloads together on the same sole-tenant node or isolate your workloads from one another on different nodes. For example, to help meet some compliance requirements, you might need to use affinity labels to separate sensitive workloads from non-sensitive workloads.
When you create a VM, you request sole-tenancy by specifying node affinity or anti-affinity, referencing one or more node affinity labels. 
You specify custom node affinity labels when you create a node template, and Compute Engine automatically includes some default affinity labels on each node. By specifying affinity when you create a VM, you can schedule VMs together on a specific node or nodes in a node group. By specifying anti-affinity when you create a VM, you can ensure that certain VMs are not scheduled together on the same node or nodes in a node group.

CPU overcommit:
CPU overcommit on sole-tenant nodes lets you schedule instances that can share their spare CPU cycles with each other. 
This lets you overprovision sole-tenant node resources and schedule more VM CPUs on a sole-tenant node than are normally available. 
CPU overcommit is especially valuable for workloads that are underutilized but might experience relatively uncorrelated bursts.

##	Compute Engine instances templates
If you need to create multiple instances with similar configuration, you can create a template first. In order to do that, choose Instance templates and click “Create instance template” button and follow the creator steps (it’s the same creator).

![Alt text](images/im68.png?raw=true "Title")

##	Compute Engine instance machine image
A machine image is a Compute Engine resource that stores all the configuration, metadata, permissions, and data from one or more disks required to create a VM instance. 

It can be used in many system maintenance scenarios, such as instance creation, backup and recovery, and instance cloning.
You just need to indicate any Source VM instance.

![Alt text](images/im69.png?raw=true "Title")

##	Compute Engine Marketplace
In Google Cloud Marketplace, you can find a lot of solutions that are ready to be used. 

You can also find there preconfigured by Google virtual machines that can be used for different purposes, e.g. databases, machine learning, analytics, big data and much more.

Instead of creating and configuring a new instance, you can just select one that fits for your purpose.

How to create a new instance, new template or machine image?

##	Managing access to Compute Engine instance
You can manage access to your instances using one of the following methods:

Linux instances:
OS Login, which allows you to associate SSH keys with your Google Account or Google Workspace account and manage admin or non-admin access to the instance through IAM roles 
SSH keys in project or instance metadata, which grants admin access to instances with metadata access that do not use OS Login 

Windows Server instances:
Create a password for a Windows Server instance

##	Connecting to Linux instance - Console

1. Go to GCP Console and open Compute Engine.
2. When you have your instance created, up and running, click “Open in browser window” in Connect SSH column.
3. A new tab should pop up.

##	Connecting to Linux instance - gcloud

GCloud is a part of Cloud SDK.

Use the gcloud compute ssh command to connect to instances that you have permission to access:
```
$ gcloud compute ssh --project=PROJECT_ID --zone=ZONE VM_NAME
```
Where: 
- PROJECT_ID - the ID of the project that contains the instance
- ZONE - the name of the zone in which the instance is located
- VM_NAME - the name of the instance
