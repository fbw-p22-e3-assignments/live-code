# Google Cloud Storage

##	What is Cloud Storage?

Cloud Storage is globally unified, scalable and highly durable object storage for developers and enterprises.

##	What is Cloud Storage?

- Infinitely scalable, fully-managed, versioned and highly-durable object storage
- Designed for 99,999999999% (“eleven nines”) durability
- Strongly consistent (even for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs)
- Integrated site hosting and CDN functionality
- Lifecycle transitions across classes: Multi-Regional, Regional, Nearline, Coldline
- All classes have same API, so can use gsutil and gcsfuse

##	Cloud Storage key features

You can virtually store as many objects as you want

By default, your data is private and encrypted

Data can be stored redundantly

You can retrieve data anytime from anywhere over the internet

**Bucket names must be unique across all existing bucket names Google Cloud Storage!**


# Cloud Storage Classes

Google Cloud Storage offers 4 different storage classes that are designed for different use cases:

- Standard Storage (multi-regional or regional): Good for “hot” data that’s accessed frequently, including websites, streaming videos, and mobile apps.

- Nearline Storage: Low cost. Good for data that can be stored for at least 30 days, including data backup and long-tail multimedia content.

- Coldline Storage: Very low cost. Good for data that can be stored for at least 90 days, including disaster recovery.

-  Archive Storage: Lowest cost. Good for data that can be stored for at least 365 days, including regulatory archives.

The following aspects apply to all storage classes:

- Unlimited storage with no minimum object size
- Worldwide accessibility and worldwide storage locations
- Low latency (time to first byte typically tens of milliseconds)
- High durability (99.999999999% annual durability)
- Geo-redundancy if the data is stored in a multi-region or dual-region
- A uniform experience with Cloud Storage features, security, tools, and API.

# Redundancy in Cloud Storage
	
## Geo-redundancy in Cloud Storage

Data that is geo-redundant is stored redundantly in at least two separate geographic places separated by at least 100 miles 

Objects stored in multi-regions and dual-regions are geo-redundant as a result of data replication, regardless of their storage class

Geo-redundancy occurs asynchronously, but all Cloud Storage data is redundant within at least one geographic place as soon as you upload it

While most objects are geo-redundant within minutes, some objects can take much longer to replicate

For example, all Cloud Storage data is redundant across at least two zones of the same region:

##	Geo-redundancy in Cloud Storage

Geo-redundancy ensures maximum availability of your data, even in the event of large-scale disruptions, such as natural disasters. 

- For dual-regions, geo-redundancy is achieved using two specific regions 

- For multi-regions, geo-redundancy is achieved using any combination of data centers within the specified multi-region, which may include data centers that are not explicitly listed as available regions

# Working with Cloud Storage
##	Access the data anywhere

You can manage Cloud Storage objects via: 
- Google Cloud Console
- gsutil tool
- client libraries (SDK)
- REST endpoints

##	CLI for Cloud Storage

Before you begin:

- Make sure you have a project already created in GCP Console.

- Download and install Cloud SDK. Cloud SDK is a set of tools that you can use to manage resources and applications hosted on Google Cloud. These tools include the gcloud, gsutil, and bq command-line tools.

- Use this link to download it: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

- Make sure you have Python installed with version 3.8. If you are using Windows and you left the relevant checkbox selected when you installed the Cloud SDK, this was done automatically.

##	CLI for Cloud Storage
	
Creating a bucket:
```
$ gsutil mb -b on -l us-east1 gs://my-awesome-bucket/
```
Uploading a file from your local computer Desktop into your bucket:
```
$ gsutil cp Desktop/kitten.png gs://my-awesome-bucket
```
Downloading a file from your bucket into Desktop:
```
$ gsutil cp gs://my-awesome-bucket/kitten.png Desktop/kitten2.png
```
Copying files from main folder to another folder called ‘just a folder’ inside your bucket:
```
$ gsutil cp gs://my-awesome-bucket/kitten.png gs://my-awesome-bucket/just-a-folder/kitten3.png
```
Listing a content of your bucket:
```
$ gsutil ls gs://my-awesome-bucket
```
Listing details of given file inside your bucket:
```
$ gsutil ls -l gs://my-awesome-bucket/kitten.png
```
Removing file from the bucket:
```
$ gsutil rm gs://my-awesome-bucket/kitten.png
```
Removing everything from given bucket (including folders and what is inside them):
```
$ gsutil rm -r gs://my-awesome-bucket
```
Giving permissions for all users to view the objects inside a bucket:
```
$ gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://my-awesome-bucket
```
Removing the permissions to read all objects inside a bucket:
```
$ gsutil iam ch -d allUsers:objectViewer gs://my-awesome-bucket
```
Giving a specific email address permission to read and write objects in your bucket:
```
$ gsutil iam ch user:jane@gmail.com:objectCreator,objectViewer gs://my-awesome-bucket
```
Removing a specific email address permission to read and write objects in your bucket:
```
$ gsutil iam ch -d user:jane@gmail.com:objectCreator,objectViewer gs://my-awesome-bucket
```

Body:	Cloud Storage Pricing

##	Cloud Storage Pricing

Cloud Storage pricing is based on the following components:
- Data storage: the amount of data stored in your buckets. Storage rates vary depending on the storage class of your data and location of your buckets
- Network usage: the amount of data read from or moved between your buckets
- Operations usage: the actions you take in Cloud Storage, such as listing the objects in your buckets
- Retrieval and early deletion fees: applicable for data stored in the Nearline Storage, Coldline Storage, and Archive Storage classes
- Inter-region replication: applicable for data replicated across regions.

# Checkpoint questions:
- What is Google Cloud Storage?
- Name Cloud Storage classes and their features.
- What are common use cases for Cloud Storage?

## Key Takeaways
- Cloud Storage is a fully managed cloud storage service
- You store data in Cloud Storage as an object inside a bucket
- You can store a virtually unlimited number of objects
- You pay for only what you use
