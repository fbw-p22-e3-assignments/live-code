- Overview of Database Services on GCP
- Relational Databases on GCP
- Use Cases and Features of Cloud SQL service

##	What are databases?

- Every application needs a place to store data from users, devices, and the application itself. 

- Databases are important backend systems that are used to store, analyze, manage, and update data for all types of applications

- Uses range from small back-office systems to mobile and consumer web applications with global scale.

##	Why databases on GCP?

- Purpose-built
  - Choose from many purpose-built database engines 
  - Support for diverse data models 
  - Build use case driven, highly scalable, distributed applications
- Performance at scale
  - Relational databases that are 3-5X faster than popular alternatives
  - Non-relational databases with microsecond to sub-millisecond latency. 
  - Start small and scale as your applications grow. 
- Fully managed
  - No need to worry about database management tasks such as server provisioning, patching, configuration, or backups. 
  - Google monitors your clusters to keep your workloads running
- Secure & highly available
  - High availability, reliability, and security
  - Support for multi-region and multi-master replication
  - Full oversight of data with multiple levels of security, including network isolation, and end-to-end encryption.

##	Database Categories
- Relational
  - Data stored in rows and columns (tables)
  - Tables relate to one another through “keys,” or information shared between both relations
  - Arow in a table is called a “record,” and a table is referred to as a “relation.”
- Non-Relational
  - Data stored in non-tabular format and often based on data structures like objects or documents
  - Can store a wide variety of information formats side-by-side
  - There exist many subtypes of non-relational databases

##	Relational Databases on GCP
- Cloud SQL
  - Managed MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. 
  - Makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud 
  - Cost-efficient and resizable capacity for your data
  - Use Cases: ERP, CRM, Ecommerce and web, Software as a Service (SaaS) application
- Cloud Spanner
  - Cloud-native with unlimited scale, consistency, and 99.999% availability.
  - Use Cases: Gaming, Global financial ledger, Supply chain/inventory management
- Bare Metal Solution for Oracle
  - Lift and shift Oracle workloads to Google Cloud.
  - Use Cases: Legacy applications, Data center retirement

  
##	What is Cloud SQL?
- Fully managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. 
- Allows to run database with Google’s rich extension collections, configuration flags and developer ecosystem, but without the hassle of self-management
- It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity 
- Automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups

##	Cloud SQL key features
- Fast, easy migrations - Database Migration Service makes it easy to migrate databases from on-premises, Compute Engine, and other clouds to Cloud SQL with minimal downtime
- Secure access and connectivity - Cloud SQL data is encrypted when on Google’s internal networks and when stored in database tables, temporary files, and backups. Cloud SQL supports private connectivity with VPC, and every Cloud SQL instance includes a network firewall.
- Built-in high availability - Replication of instance to another zone or region with just a click of a button.
- Scalability - Possibility to add up to 96 processor cores and more than 624 GB of RAM and 30 TB of storage and add read replicas (replication is the ability to create copies of a Cloud SQL instance and offload work to the copies).
- Cloud SQL Insights - Pre-built dashboards and visual query plans help developers identify the root cause of problems. Database metrics and traces can be accessed in existing tools using OpenTelemetry. 
- Automatic storage increases - Cloud SQL can automatically scale up storage capacity when it is near the limit. 
- High performance - Cloud SQL supports performance-intensive workloads with up to 60,000 IOPS and no extra cost for IO. 
- Easy integration - Easily connect from App Engine, Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, and the workstation. Open up analytics possibilities by using BigQuery to directly query Cloud SQL databases. 
- Real-time change data capture and replication - Seamlessly delivers change streams from Oracle and MySQL databases into Google Cloud services such as BigQuery, Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Storage, and Cloud Spanner for up-to-date information. 
- Automatic backups - Automates daily backups and binary logging (for replication or point-in-time recovery). 
- Point-in-time recovery - Restores the instance to its state at an earlier point in time. 



##	Google Cloud SQL Engines
- Each DB instance runs a DB engine.  Cloud SQL currently supports the following DB engines:
  - MySQL, 
  - PostgreSQL, 
  - Microsoft SQL Server 
- Each DB engine has its own supported features and versions

##	What is a Cloud SQL Instance?
- Each Cloud SQL instance is powered by a virtual machine (VM) running on a host Google Cloud server. 
- Each VM operates the database program, such as MySQL Server, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, and service agents that provide supporting services, such as logging and monitoring. 
- The high availability option also provides a standby VM in another zone with a configuration that's identical to the primary VM.
- The database is stored on a scalable, durable network storage device called a persistent disk that attaches to the VM. 
- A static IP address sits in front of each VM to ensure that the IP address an application connects to persist throughout the lifetime of the Cloud SQL instance.

##	Cloud SQL machine types

Machine types that you can select for your Cloud SQL instance:
- Shared core
- Lightweight 
- Standard (Most common) 
- High memory

For each you need to also choose CPUs and memory or select “Custom”.
When selecting “Custom” you need to remember about given constraints:
- vCPUs must be either 1 or an even number between 2 and 96.
- Memory must be:
  - 0.9 to 6.5 GB per vCPU
  - A multiple of 256 MB
  - At least 3.75 GB (3840 MB)


##	Cloud SQL pricing
Cloud SQL pricing depends on:
- How much storage is provisioned (in GiB per month)
- How many CPUs are selected 
- How much memory is selected 
- Where the data is hosted
- How much network traffic leaves the instance
- How many IP addresses is assigned and used

You can use Google Cloud Calculator to evaluate total cost of the instance.

## Checkpoint Questions
- Name database engines that you can use in Google Cloud SQL
- What influences on the cost of Cloud SQL usage

## Keys takeaways
- Cloud SQL is a database service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
- Cloud SQL offers features for automated redundancy and backups.
- Cloud SQL supports database engines, which includes PostgreSQL, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server
