# About computer networks

## What is a computer network?

A computer network is a collection of computing devices that are logically connected to communicate and share resources.

A node refers to any device on a network. Examples of nodes can be servers, switches, modems, or even printers.

A host device is a node that has unique function: other devices connect to nodes so they can access data or other services. A server is an example of a host because a server can provide access to data, run an application, or provide a service.

##	Elements of a computer network

### Client 

A client is a computer hardware device that accesses the data or a service that is managed by another computer hardware device, which is called a server.

The client connects to the server over a network.

A client can also refer to software on the accessing device. For example, a web browser is a client for accessing content from a web server.

### Server

A server provides a response to a request from a client computer over a network.

Examples: 
- Web server
- Database server
- File server
- Mail server
- Print server

###	Network interface card (NIC)

A network interface card (NIC) connects a computer to a computer network. It is also sometimes referred to as a network adapter.

It uses a cable that is connected to a hub or a switch.

Each NIC has its own media access control (MAC) address. The MAC address is a unique physical (hardware) identifier. It is assigned by the manufacturer, and is used to identify the sender and receiver of data.

### Network cable: (COAXIAL)

A coaxial cable (or coax) contains a central conductor wire (typically copper) that is surrounded by an insulating material. This insulating material, in turn, is surrounded by a braided metal shield. The entire cable is then enclosed in a jacket. 

Today, the most common uses for coaxial cables are to connect a cable TV modem to an internet service provider (ISP), and to connect TVs to cable boxes.

###	Network cable: (TWISTED-PAIR)
The most common type of computer, telephone, and network cable is known as a twisted-pair. It is more commonly known as an Ethernet cable. The cable consists of color-coded pairs of insulated copper wires that are bundled together in the same jacket. 

Twisted-pair cabling is available in two types: shielded (STP) and unshielded (UTP). Shielding further prevents electromagnetic interference.

###	Network cable: (FIBER-OPTIC):

A fiber-optic cable has four components:
- Glass fiber (the core) 
- Cladding (the part that makes the light reflect down the fiber)
- Buffer material (for strength)
- Insulating jacket

A fiber-optic cable transmits light instead of electricity. Thus, it is a good choice for use in areas that have high levels of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and for long-distance transmissions. A single copper cable cannot carry data more than a few hundred meters, but a single piece of fiber-optic cabling can transmit data over distances of several kilometers.

###	Hub and switch:
	
A hub or switch is a device that connects all the nodes of a network together. Every hardwired device in the network uses a network adapter, or NIC, to connect directly to a port on the hub or switch through a single cable.

![Alt text](images/im26.png?raw=true "Title")
	
Hub:

- A device that transmits data that is received on one port to all the other ports on the hub. 

- If one node sends data, all the others receive it, but only the intended recipient listens to it.
	
Switch:
  
- A device that transmits data to only the receiving device. It makes a direct link by using MAC addresses between the transmitting device and the receiving device.

- It improves performance because it does not use bandwidth on unnecessary transmissions.

Router Diagram:

The diagram shows two switched networks (which are also called subnets) - Department A  and Department B- that are interconnected through a router.

![Alt text](images/im27.png?raw=true "Title")

### Router:

A router is a network device that connects multiple network segments into one network.

Connects multiple switches and their respective networks to form a larger network (that is, it acts as a switch between networks).

Can also filter the data that flows through it, which enables data to be routed differently, depending on need.

	
## Checkpoint Questions

- Which network device should you use to connect multiple networks?

- Which device makes a direct link (by using MAC addresses) between the transmitting device and receiving device?

- Which type of cable transmits light instead of electricity?

## Key takeaways
A computer network is a collection of computing devices that are logically connected to communicate and share resources.
The main components of a computer network include:
- Client devices
- Servers
- Network adapters (NICs) and cables
- Hubs and switches 
- Routers
	
# What is IP?
##	What is IP?

IP is a network protocol that establishes the rules for relaying and routing data on the internet.

IP is a critical standard within the larger TCP/IP protocol suite 

TCP/IP implements the set of protocols - it enables the successful routing of network traffic among devices on a network. 

Some useful points about TCP/IP include that it:
- Uses IP addresses to identify devices
- Uses port numbers to identify endpoints
- Supports subnetting to subdivide a network

![Alt text](images/im28.png?raw=true "Title")

##	IP addresses
An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network. Each device on a network has an IP address, and it serves two main functions:

- It identifies a host and a network. 
- IP addresses are also used for location addressing.

![Alt text](images/im29.png?raw=true "Title")

IP addresses can be assigned to devices in a dynamic or static way. 

- A device with a dynamic address has an assigned IP address that can change. This feature is useful in scenarios where devices might leave and come back to a network, like a work-assigned laptop that travels from the work network to the user's home network. 

- A device with a static address has an IP address that does not change. This feature can be useful in many scenarios, such as servers or printers on a network that other devices often connect to.

##	IP addresses

IP addresses can also be made public or private:

A public IP address is an IP address that can be accessed over the internet. 
A public IP address is a globally unique IP address that is assigned to a computing device that must access the internet.

A private IP address is assigned to computers within a private network and they cannot be accessed from the internet. 
Private addresses work well for use cases when an address is assigned to a device that you do not want other devices to know about, e.g. the application and database servers in your data center

![Alt text](images/im30.png?raw=true "Title")

### Example 

Suppose the range of IP addresses is 10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255.

The default router address is typically the second address in the range: 10.0.0.1

The default router address is also known as the gateway address, and it is the IP address of the network router.

The broadcast address is the last address in the range: 10.255.255.255

The broadcast address is used to transmit messages to all devices that are connected to a network. If a message is sent to a broadcast address, then all nodes on the network can receive it. 
Body:	What is a subnet?

##	What is a subnet?

A subnet is network inside a network. Subnetting is the process of creating smaller networks by dividing a large block of addresses into several contiguous subdivisions. 

A subnet creates multiple logical networks with different ranges of IP addresses. 
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is used to specify subnet IP address ranges and describing the size of a network.
Devices that are in the same subnet can communicate with each other without using any routers.

![Alt text](images/im31.png?raw=true "Title")

##	Purpose of subnetting

Subnetting can be used to organize and optimize a network. For example, you can use subnets to:

Isolate different parts of the network

Apply different levels of security to different parts of the network

Relieve congestion on the network

![Alt text](images/im32.png?raw=true "Title")

Consider the following example:

A company has a network that connects two of its buildings, the Manufacturing building and the Warehouse building. 
The network was assigned the IP address range of 145.8.x.x. 
The company wants to create two separate subnets to provide a level of isolation between the devices in each building.

![Alt text](images/im33.png?raw=true "Title")

The subnet for the Manufacturing building is assigned a subset of the network's IP address range—specifically, 145.8.1.x.
Likewise, the Warehouse building is assigned a different subset of the network's IP address range, which is 145.8.2.x.

A subnet mask defines which section of the address identifies the network, and which section identifies the hosts.
A router or default gateway is used by devices on one network to communicate with the devices in another network.

![Alt text](images/im34.png?raw=true "Title")

![Alt text](images/im35.png?raw=true "Title")
Each subnet's IP address range is a distinct subset of the overall network's IP address range

## Key takeaways
- IP subnetting enables you to divide a single network into multiple logical subnetworks.
- Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is used to specify the IP address range of a subnet.
- A CIDR block uses the format x.x.x.x/n, where:
  - x.x.x.x is an IP address
  - /n specifies the length in bits of the network prefix portion of the IP address

	
# What is VPC?
##	Regions and Zones
Compute Engine resources are hosted in multiple locations worldwide. These locations are composed of regions and zones. 
GCP has 11 regions, 33 zones and over 100 points of presence throughout the globe.

![Alt text](images/im36.png?raw=true "Title")

A region is a specific geographical location where you can host your resources. 
Regions have three or more zones. 
For example, the us-west1 region denotes a region on the west coast of the United States that has three zones: us-west1-a, us-west1-b.
This is constantly changing because Google is expanding their network all the time.

![Alt text](images/im37.png?raw=true "Title")

##	Regions and Zones
While some core resources in GCP are global, others may be restricted by region or zone. 
Regional resources can be used anywhere within the same region.
Zonal resources can be used anywhere within the same zone. 
Some examples of this are:
- Global Resources:
  - Images
  - Snapshots
  - VPC Network
  - Firewalls
  - Routes
- Regional Resources:
  - Static external IP addresses
  - Subnets
- Zonal Resources:
  - Instances (VMs)
  - Persistent Disks

##	Google Cloud VPC
Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service that you can use to provision a logically isolated section of the Cloud, which is called a virtual private cloud, or VPC. VPC provides networking for cloud-based services that is global, scalable, and flexible.
A VPC network provides the following:
- Provides connectivity for Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances, including Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters, App Engine flexible environment instances, and other Google Cloud products built on Compute Engine VMs.
- Offers built-in Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and proxy systems for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing.
- Connects to on-premises networks using Cloud VPN tunnels and Cloud Interconnect attachments.
- Distributes traffic from Google Cloud external load balancers to backends.

##	Default VPC
Unless you choose to disable it, each new project starts with a default VPC network. 
The default network is an auto mode VPC network with pre-populated IPv4 firewall rules. The default network does not have pre-populated IPv6 firewall rules.

##	Default VPC in GCP console

![Alt text](images/im39.png?raw=true "Title")


##	Subnets

Each VPC network consists of one or more useful IP range partitions called subnets. 

Each subnet is associated with a region. 
VPC networks do not have any IP address ranges associated with them. IP ranges are defined for the subnets.
The terms subnet and subnetwork are synonymous. They are used interchangeably in the Google Cloud Console, gcloud commands, and API documentation.
A (VPC) network must have at least one subnet before you can use it!

##	Subnets creation mode
Google Cloud offers two types of VPC networks, determined by their subnet creation mode:
- When an auto mode VPC network is created, one subnet from each region is automatically created within it.  These automatically created subnets use a set of predefined IPv4 ranges that fit within the 10.128.0.0/9 CIDR block.  As new Google Cloud regions become available, new subnets in those regions are automatically added to auto mode VPC networks by using an IP range from that block.

- When a custom mode VPC network is created, no subnets are automatically created.  This type of network provides you with complete control over its subnets and IP ranges.

##	Default VPC

You can see here the default VPC network spanning multiple regions and zones, and subnets within various parts of the network servicing virtual machines. 

All of these subnets can natively route to each other, and as long as the firewalls permit it, virtual machines can reach one another within this VPC.

VPC networks, including their associated routes and firewall rules, are global resources. They are not associated with any particular region or zone.

![Alt text](images/im40.png?raw=true "Title")

##	IP Addresses

Each virtual machine instance in GCP will have an internal IP address and typically an external IP address.  

The internal IP address is used to communicate between instances in the same VPC network.

The external IP address is used to communicate with instances in other networks or the Internet. 

These IP addresses are ephemeral by default but can be statically assigned.

##	Routes

Routes tell virtual machine (VM) instances and the VPC network how to send traffic from an instance to a destination, either inside the network or outside of Google Cloud. 

Each VPC network comes with some system-generated routes to route traffic among its subnets and send traffic from eligible instances to the internet.

You can create custom static routes to direct some packets to specific destinations.
##	Routes

![Alt text](images/im41.png?raw=true "Title")

##	Firewall rules
VPC firewall rules let you allow or deny connections to or from your virtual machine (VM) instances based on a configuration that you specify. 

Enabled VPC firewall rules are always enforced, protecting your instances regardless of their configuration and operating system, even if they have not started up.

Every VPC network functions as a distributed firewall. While firewall rules are defined at the network level, connections are allowed or denied on a per-instance basis. 

You can think of the VPC firewall rules as existing not only between your instances and other networks, but also between individual instances within the same network.
